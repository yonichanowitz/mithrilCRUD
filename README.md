basic CRUD app using mithril.js

<h1>Basic CRUD app using mithril</h1>

<p> the goal of this app was to learn how mithril deals with state, routing, lifecycle events and parent child inheritting/passing data</p>

<p>You will need to install Webpack. and Webpack-cli, aswell as `mithril.js` (obviously) and `serve.js`</p>

for development i had two terminals open with one using webpack on watch mode to compile, and the other using npx `npx serve .` to serve the app

please criticize this app as i aim to learn and grow. contact me @yonichanowitz on pretty much every social media app
